## URGENT: Hot Job to Bid On

**ICAP Patent Brokerage - $3,500**
- Website Redesign & Client Portal (Tiered Access)
- Posted 1 hour ago, only 5-10 proposals
- US-only (filters competition)
- Looking for: B2B, legal, finance, enterprise portfolio
- User is PERFECT fit (Goldman Sachs, SAP background)

### Ready-to-Submit Proposal:

```
Hi,

I've built enterprise web systems for Goldman Sachs, SAP, and EA Games - exactly the B2B/finance/legal aesthetic you're describing.

MY APPROACH FOR ICAP:

Architecture recommendation: Astro or Next.js frontend + Cloudflare Pages for speed and security. Tiered portal via JWT authentication with role-based access (Public → Client → Admin). Clean, legal-tech aesthetic with strong typography and whitespace.

SECURITY CONSIDERATION:

For a firm handling sensitive IP materials, I'd recommend a static architecture (Astro/Next.js) on Cloudflare over WordPress.

Why: No database to inject, no PHP attack surface, enterprise-grade WAF included. WordPress can be secured (Wordfence, hardening), but requires ongoing maintenance and is the most-targeted CMS globally.

The tiered portal authentication would use Cloudflare Access or a lightweight auth layer - battle-tested enterprise security without the WordPress maintenance burden.

Happy to discuss tradeoffs if you have a strong WordPress preference.

RELEVANT WORK:
- masumihayashi.com - Clean, modern portfolio (90+ Lighthouse score)
- deankeesey.com/hire - My service packages and approach
- Enterprise UI at SAP SuccessFactors (millions of users)

I'm comfortable proposing architecture and discussing tradeoffs, not just executing specs.

Happy to discuss scope and phasing on a quick call.

Dean

- [ ] 2 specialized profiles created
- [ ] 3+ more job applications submitted
- [ ] /hire page deployed (git push)

## Watch Out For
- Upwork can be glitchy - if forms fail, try removing special characters
- Don't overthink proposals - speed matters in first 24 hours
- User has strong feelings about WordPress security (was hacked before) - position Cloudflare/static as secure alternative
- Animation is long-game positioning; Cloud/Stripe is quick-win path to $1000
