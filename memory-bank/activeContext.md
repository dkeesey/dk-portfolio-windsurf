- **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure complex timeline component works perfectly on mobile recruiter devices
- **Performance Balance**: Maintain fast loading while adding visual richness and animations

## Next Steps
1. **Review Logo Consistency** - Test development site at localhost:4321 to verify all logos display with consistent white background styling

4. **Performance Audit** - Ensure component doesn't negatively impact Core Web Vitals
5. **Deploy and Monitor** - Push changes live and track engagement metrics from recruiters

## Open Questions
- Should we create a separate "Leadership Experience" section to highlight management roles?
- Do we need additional enterprise project case studies beyond the timeline?
- How prominent should AWS certifications be in the enterprise positioning?

## Current Mode
