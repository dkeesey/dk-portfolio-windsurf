## Active Decisions
- **Enterprise-First Strategy**: ACTIVE - Prioritize Fortune 500 brand recognition over recent consulting work
- **Visual Impact Design**: ACTIVE - Use company logos, enterprise badges, and professional hierarchy to maximize recruiter impact  
- **Complete Timeline Approach**: ACTIVE - Show full career progression rather than hiding older enterprise experience

## Current Challenges
- **Remaining Logo Assets**: Need logos for Goldman Sachs, Prudential, Oracle (if desired for enhanced brand recognition)
- **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure complex timeline component works perfectly on mobile recruiter devices
- **Performance Balance**: Maintain fast loading while adding visual richness and animations

## Next Steps
1. **Blog Diagram Modal Testing**: Test the new DiagramFigure component across different devices and browsers
2. **Blog Visual Enhancement**: Add remaining hero images for other blog posts to enhance visual appeal
3. **Modal Component Refinement**: Based on testing, optimize modal UX and add keyboard navigation features
4. **Performance Audit**: Ensure blog images and modals are optimized for Core Web Vitals
5. **SEO Enhancement**: Add proper alt text and optimize image loading for blog posts

## Open Questions
- Which specific AI blog posts should use the technical diagrams?
- What style/theme should guide hero image selection for blog posts?
- Should technical diagrams be updated or used as-is from previous creation?

## Current Mode
READY FOR NEXT SESSION - Blog visual enhancement phase

## Session Handoff Prompt
"I've implemented the blog diagram modal component! The DiagramFigure.astro component is ready for testing at http://localhost:4321/blog/ai-multi-agent-coordination. The component provides click-to-enlarge functionality for SVG diagrams with hover effects, modal overlays, and accessibility features. Test the three diagrams I added, then we can enhance other blog posts and optimize the UX based on your feedback."

## Last Session Learnings
**Session 2025-05-23: Enterprise Portfolio Polish & Production Deployment**

Key technical learnings for future sessions:
1. **SVG Logo Optimization**: Company logos often have excessive whitespace in viewBox - inspect coordinates and crop by adjusting viewBox parameters (Agency.com: 82% reduction, Prudential: 85% reduction)
2. **Chrome SVG Download Behavior**: Chrome converts SVGs to PNG when using "Save image as" - use Inspect Element → copy src URL or view source for actual SVG files
3. **Animation UX Principle**: Vertical content (timelines) should animate vertically (y-axis) not horizontally (x-axis) for natural, less jarring user experience
4. **Enterprise Logo Strategy**: Fortune 500 brand recognition significantly enhances credibility - dual logos work well for subsidiary relationships (SAP+SuccessFactors, McKesson+iKnowMed)
5. **Client Relationship Display**: Custom layout for agency work should show agency logo prominently with client logos as "Enterprise Clients" below to clarify relationship hierarchy
6. **Astro + React Props Chain**: Layout modifications require prop passing through: index.astro → Layout.astro → Layout.tsx → Header.tsx for conditional features
7. **Badge Hover States**: Display-only elements should use `pointer-events-none` to prevent confusing hover states that reduce readability

**Production Deployment Process**: Two successful deployments with comprehensive commit messages capturing full feature scope for future reference.
