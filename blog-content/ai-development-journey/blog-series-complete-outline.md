# "Building Production AI Infrastructure: A Developer's Journey"
## Complete Blog Series Outline (10 Digestible Posts)

### **Phase 1: Infrastructure Foundations**

#### Post 1: "The M4 Mac Mini Gamble: Why 64GB RAM and Memory Bandwidth Changed Everything"
*Hook*: "Everyone said 'just use external storage.' What they missed was that AI development isn't just about storage—it's about memory bandwidth and preventing systemic failure."
- External SSD → latency penalty discovery
- Strategic decision: 512GB internal + 64GB unified memory
- **Memory bandwidth revelation**: Why shared RAM architecture matters for AI workloads
- The one system freeze that changed everything (memory leak after long session)
- **Resource philosophy**: Overpowered local → prevents cascade failures
- **Future strategy**: Local development → cloud production transition
- **Takeaway**: Infrastructure decisions compound; memory bandwidth > raw storage

#### Post 2: "The NPX Security Crisis Nobody's Talking About"
*Hook*: "While developers run random npm packages as MCP servers, I built a security framework that may have saved my entire development environment."
- The naive NPX approach and its dangers
- Provider preference hierarchy (Microsoft > Notion > Community)
- Local installation strategy and version pinning
- **Takeaway**: Security-first MCP server management

#### Post 3: "When Your AI Assistant Goes to Sleep: The Mac Sleep Cycle Problem"
*Hook*: "My AI could access 15 different services—until I closed my laptop. Here's how we solved the reliability crisis."
- JSON malformation after Mac sleep cycles
- Hard restart discovery (the nuclear option)
- MCP server restart scripts (subset and full)
- **Takeaway**: Production AI needs production-grade reliability

### **Phase 2: Architecture Evolution**

#### Post 4: "The Great Memory System Failure (And What We Built Instead)"
*Hook*: "When your AI memory depends on the same fragile servers it's trying to manage, you're building a house of cards."
- MCP-only memory → cascading failures
- Hybrid architecture: files + SQLite + MCP
- Redundant access patterns for reliability
- **Takeaway**: Resilient memory architecture principles

#### Post 5: "Why I Abandoned 'Do It For Me' AI Platforms"
*Hook*: "Bolt and Lovable promised to build my apps. Instead, I discovered something better: the art of AI collaboration."
- The false promise of full automation
- Meta-prompt strategy with checkboxes and structured requirements
- Why Cursor + CDT + meta-prompts beat automated platforms
- **Takeaway**: Structured collaboration > black box automation

#### Post 6: "The Multi-LLM Experiment That Convinced Me to Stop"
*Hook*: "What if Claude could access GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude simultaneously? We built it. Here's why we turned it off."
- Context adaptation overhead discovery
- Performance degradation vs. theoretical benefits
- Why single excellent LLM > multiple compromised LLMs
- **Takeaway**: Context preservation is king in AI workflows

### **Phase 3: Workflow Maturity**

#### Post 7: "From Task Decomposition MCPs to Native Claude 3.7: When to Stop Building"
*Hook*: "I built a custom task decomposition MCP server. Then Claude 3.7 made it obsolete. Here's what that taught me."
- Custom task decomposition plugin development
- Recognition that Claude 3.7 native capabilities exceeded custom solutions
- When to build vs. when to adopt
- **Takeaway**: Know when your custom tools become technical debt

#### Post 8: "Sequential Thinking: The MCP That Changed Everything"
*Hook*: "This one MCP server transformed how I approach complex problems with AI."
- Discovery of sequential thinking MCP
- Complex task chains and sophisticated goal achievement
- Before/after examples of problem-solving capability
- **Takeaway**: The right tools unlock emergent capabilities

#### Post 9: "The Art of AI Meta-Prompting: Beyond Simple Instructions"
*Hook*: "Most developers treat AI like a search engine. I treat it like a sophisticated collaborator. Here's the difference."
- Evolution from basic prompts to structured meta-prompts
- Markdown files with checkboxes and systematic requirements
- How this led to switching from Windsurf to CDT + Cursor
- **Takeaway**: Prompt engineering as collaborative framework design

#### Post 10: "Building an AI Development Stack That Actually Works in Production"
*Hook*: "After three months of failures, experiments, and discoveries, here's the AI development infrastructure that changed how I build software."
- Complete architecture overview
- Integration of all learned principles
- ROI analysis and competitive advantages
- **Takeaway**: Your complete blueprint for production AI development
